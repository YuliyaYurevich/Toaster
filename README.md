# Toaster

Users should be able to:

    When the page first loads, the toaster should be hidden. 
    If the user moves their mouse toward the top of the page (exit intent) display the pop-up. 
    If the user has been on the site for more than 5 seconds, display the pop-up.
    Clicking on the close button, makes the toaster disappear.
